**Experiment 1: Basics of C++**

**‚úÖ Aim:**

To understand the basic structure, syntax, and working of a C++ program by implementing:

A basic "Hello World" output program.

A simple calculator using basic arithmetic operations.

**üß† Theory:**
C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was developed as an extension of the C language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming features, making it widely used in software development.

Structure of a C++ Program:
Every C++ program has the following basic components:

Preprocessor directives (e.g., #include <iostream>)

Main function: The entry point of the program (int main())

Statements and expressions

Input/output operations using cin and cout

Semicolons at the end of each statement

Curly braces {} to define blocks

C++ is case-sensitive and follows a strict syntax that helps in writing efficient and structured programs.

Key features of C++ include:

Simple syntax similar to C.

Strong support for OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

Rich standard libraries for input/output, mathematics, algorithms, and data structures.

**üñ•Ô∏è Program 1: Hello World****
This is the simplest program that demonstrates how to print a message to the screen using cout.

Objective:
To write and execute a basic C++ program that displays "Hello, World!" on the screen.

**üñ© Program 2: Simple Calculato**r
This program demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and input/output statements. It performs basic mathematical operations on two numbers entered by the user.

Objective:
To develop a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers based on user input.

**üìò Conclusion:**

In this experiment, we learned the basic structure of a C++ program and how to perform simple input, output, and arithmetic operations. This forms the foundation for writing more complex C++ programs.
