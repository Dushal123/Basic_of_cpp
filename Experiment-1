 1. Hello World Program in C++
âœ… Aim:
To understand the basic structure and syntax of a C++ program by writing a program that displays the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.

ðŸ§  Theory:
The "Hello World" program is considered the most basic and introductory program when learning a new programming language. It serves multiple purposes:

Familiarizes you with the structure of a C++ program.

Teaches you how to display output on the screen.

Gives a first-hand understanding of how the program is written, compiled, and executed.

ðŸ”¸ Components involved:
Header File Inclusion:

C++ uses libraries for functionalities like input and output.

The iostream library is used to handle input from the keyboard and output to the screen.

Namespace:

std is the standard namespace that includes common functions like cout.

It avoids the need to write std::cout every time.

Main Function:

Every C++ program begins execution from the main() function.

It is essential for the compiler to identify the starting point of the program.

Output Statement:

cout is used to send output to the console.

endl is used to move the cursor to the next line.

Return Statement:

return 0; indicates that the program has successfully completed.

ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes:
Understanding basic syntax and program structure.

Introduction to input/output operations.

Learning how the compiler and linker work together to run a C++ program.

ðŸ”š Conclusion:
The "Hello World" program provides a simple and clear starting point for beginners. It introduces the essential building blocks of C++ and helps verify that the compiler and development environment are set up correctly.

 2. Simple Calculator Program in C++
âœ… Aim:
To develop a simple calculator program in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers based on user input.

ðŸ§  Theory:
A simple calculator is a common beginner-level programming task that helps in learning:

Taking user input using the cin command.

Using variables to store numeric values.

Implementing conditional statements (if-else or switch-case) to handle different operations.

Applying arithmetic operators for calculation.

ðŸ”¸ Key Concepts Covered:
Input/Output Handling:

The program accepts two numbers and an operator from the user.

It displays the result using cout.

Data Types:

Variables are declared using types like int, float, or double depending on the required precision.

Control Flow:

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on the operator provided.

switch-case or if-else statements help in selecting the correct operation.

Arithmetic Operators:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

/ for division

Validation:

The program may include checks to handle invalid input such as division by zero or unsupported operators.

Error Handling (Optional):

If the user enters an invalid operator, the program can display an error message.

Division by zero should also be handled carefully.

ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes:
Handling real-world problems using logical structures.

Learning to process user input and apply decision-making.

Understanding the role of operators and conditional logic in programming.

ðŸ”š Conclusion:
The Simple Calculator program is a foundational exercise for understanding how logic and user interaction work together in C++. It builds core concepts such as decision-making, operators, and user-defined input/output, which are essential for further programming development.
